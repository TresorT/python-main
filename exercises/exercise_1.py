# You were tasked with creating the famous ‘Hello World’
# application in a few different ways.

# Solution 1:
# The following code successfully concatenates three strings together using
# the + operator:
print('Hello' + ' ' + 'World')

# Solution 2:
# The following code successfully concatenates a string variable and a string
# literal together:
greeting = 'Hello'
print(greeting + ' World')

# Solution 3:
# The following code successfully passes two separate arguments to the print
# function:
print('Hello', 'World')

# Notice that each argument is separated by a space when printed.
# This is the default behaviour of the print function.
